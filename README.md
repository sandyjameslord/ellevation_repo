This is the repository for the MEVN stack webapp that I produced for the Ellevation Data Challenge. One aspect of the challenge
asked to account for processing many files. One aspect of processing many files is sending and receiving them. To facilitate receiving and sending them
I created webapp that uses a mongodb database connected to an AWS bucket. I use Vue with HTML and CSS for frontend and Node and Nuxt for backend work. I have incorporated Ellevation's color scheme and its logo in the app. A client can submit their MCAS data csv along with their district name. A user on Ellevation's end can then see every client's district name as well as download the associated csv. There is also an option to download all files simultaneously.

As this is a prototype, there are some minor issues. Currently, the submission button for a client does not work. I am working on it. I can upload using Postman but there is some difficulty with my POST api interacting with Multer to upload the csv to the bucket.
